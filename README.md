# _Get a Card_
We're living in a digital world and the changes didn't skip the world of marketing either, which has been changed dramatically in recent years. One of the major changes applies to business cards, which from a small physical card, has gone digital and creative.
Because of that, I've decided to build this web service - Get a Card!
